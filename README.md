# [samgomena.github.io](#)

While GH pages still supports it, I've opted to host the website on my personal infrastructure, which means it's now located [here](https://sam.gomena.io).

### Why was it moved?

It was moved because I wanted to use a custom domain and github pages doesn't allow custom domains to be served over https which was unacceptable to me.

Instead, I'm using a digital ocean droplet, cloudflare, and let's encrypt for a mostly self-managing server!

### Why does it look like that?
The background gradients are scraped and parsed via [eggradients](https://eggradients.com) and then chosen randomly.
(Don't worry, they're scraped via a manual trigger about every 6 months).

Don't like the theme that's loaded? Change it by clicking `Try a different theme?` in the bottom right corner!
