# [samgomena.github.io](#)

jk, the website is now located [here](https://gomena.io).

### Why was it moved?

It was moved because github pages wouldn't allow custom domains to be served over https and that was unacceptable.
So, using digital ocean, cloudflare, and let's encrypt we were able to get it setup properly.

### Why does it look like that?
The background gradients are scraped and parsed via [eggradients](https://eggradients.com) and then chosen randomly.
