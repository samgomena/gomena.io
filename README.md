# [samgomena.github.io](#)

While GH pages still supports it, I've opted to host the website on my personal infrastructure, which is located [here](https://sam.gomena.io).

### Why was it moved?

It was moved because I wanted to use a custom domain and github pages doesn't allow custom domains to be served over https and therefore  was unacceptable.

So, I instead used digital ocean, cloudflare, and let's encrypt to get it set up properly.

### Why does it look like that?
The background gradients are scraped and parsed via [eggradients](https://eggradients.com) and then chosen randomly.

Don't like the theme it loads? Change it by clicking '[Try a different theme?](#)' (dead link) in the bottom right corner.
